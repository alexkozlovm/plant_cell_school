<h3>Plant Cells, by Alex Kozlov</h3>

<h4>Introduction:</h4>
<p>Cells are the building blocks of living things, 
    as in all living things are made of them. 
    Cells are not found in nonliving things but 
    found in plants and animals, although cells 
    are diffrent they very much depending if they 
    are a animal or a plant cell.</p>

    <h4>Plant Cells introduction:</h4>
    <p>Plant cells are as I said quite different
    than animal cells, some of the characteristics 
    of the plant cell include; the shape of the 
    plant cell ( rigid), the chloroplasts, cell 
    wall, cell membrane, vacuole, and the nucleus.
    Some of these ( vacuole , rigid cell structure,
    cell wall, and chloroplasts) are specific to a 
    plant cell. In conclusion the plant cell has 
    6 main orgenells; a nucleus, cell membrane, cell
    wall, vacuole, and chloroplasts

    <h4>Here is the quiz to take to test your 
    knowlege:</h4>

    <h5>How many (main) orgenells are there in a 
    plant cell?</h5>
